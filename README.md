# Everything Starts with Water

Earth has 370 quintillion gallons of water â€“ but only 0.01% of that is freshwater that we can use. As climate change alters the global water cycle, this precious resource is in danger of becoming even more scarce. Your challenge is to create a visual tool to help students better understand the complete path of water across the entire Earth system and how the availability of this critical resource is affected by our changing climate.
